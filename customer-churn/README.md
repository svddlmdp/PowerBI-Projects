ðŸš€ Dive into Data with Power BI â€“ Churn Analysis Project

Hey everyone,
Iâ€™m excited to share one of my recent Power BI projects, where I worked with a churn analysis dataset to explore customer behavior and retention patterns. While the dataset itself is sample data, the insights and hands-on experience it provides are highly valuableâ€”especially for those getting started in data analytics and visualization.

In this project, I used Power BI to build an interactive dashboard packed with key KPIs, slicers, custom visuals, and drill-through reports. The goal was to not only visualize churn metrics clearly but also to make the data tell a storyâ€”one that can guide better business decisions.

Why am I sharing this? Because I believe Power BI is one of the most powerful tools for bringing data to life. Whether you're just starting out or sharpening your skills, this project is a great way to learn how to:
Work with different chart types,
Apply filters and DAX measures,
Build impactful visual reports, and
Gain real, actionable insights from data.

ðŸŽ¯ Want to try it yourself?
Iâ€™ve shared the dataset on my GitHub â€” feel free to download it and recreate your own version of the dashboard. And when you do, Iâ€™d love to see it!
