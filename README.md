ðŸ“Š Power BI Projects â€“ End-to-End Dashboards for Real-World Use Cases

Welcome to my Power BI project repositoryâ€”a centralized collection of interactive dashboards and data stories designed to showcase my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights. These projects demonstrate my end-to-end capabilities across data analysis, modeling, transformation, and visualization.

Each folder in this repository represents a unique business scenarioâ€”ranging from customer churn analysis and sales performance tracking to financial risk reporting and HR analytics. The datasets used are either publicly available, simulated, or anonymized, but the approach and techniques reflect real-world standards.

The core tools and techniques applied across projects include:

Data modeling using star schema designs and relationship management.

Power Query (M language) for robust data transformation.

DAX calculations for dynamic metrics and KPIs.

Use of custom visuals, drill-throughs, and tooltips for enhanced user experience.

Integration with external data sources like Excel, CSV, and SQL Server.

Each project includes:

A .pbix file

A short business summary and objective

Key performance indicators tracked

Screenshots and sample visuals

Notes on challenges addressed and business outcomes supported

This repository not only reflects my technical expertise but also my focus on business value, clean design, and user engagement. Whether youâ€™re exploring Power BI for learning or assessing my professional portfolio, I hope these projects demonstrate the quality, clarity, and impact I aim to bring to every analytics solution.

Feel free to fork, download, and try them yourself. Feedback and collaboration are always welcome. If you use or build upon any of these, tag meâ€”Iâ€™d love to see what you create!
